# Shell Expansions
# Description
Those are used for run commands efficiently and do complex searches in files arranging and indexing.

# 1. Brace expansion:
It is used to generate discrete strings of characters for execute queries in files efficiently.

1. Brace Expansion: It works like an string generator, it uses the characters `{}` for generating string separated by coma (`,`) or two continuous points (`..`)
2. Examples:
	1. 

| Pattern          | Result                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| {str1,str2,str3} | string1 string2 string3} |
| {1..5}           | 1 2 3 4 5                |
| {a..d}           | a b c d                  |
| {a,b}{1,2}       | a1 a2 b1 b2              |
| {a,{1,2},b,c}    | a1 a2,b c                |
# 2. Path name expansion and pattern matching
Expands a pattern of special characters called wildcards or list files names that matches with the pattern

| Pattern       | Matching                                                                                                                 |

| `[!abc...]`   | Any character that do not matches with those that are inside de braces.                                                  |
| `[^abc...]`   | Any character that do not matches with those that are inside de braces.                                                  |
| `[[:alpha:]]` | Any alphabetic character                                                                                                 |
| `[[:lower:]]` | Any lowercase character                                                                                                  |

| `[[:alnum:]]` | Any alphanumerical character                                                                                             |
